## Section 1: Introduction

The box office industry is one of the largest global markets in the entertainment industry. According to **IMDbPro**,the industry has an `annual average box office revenue` of around ***11 to 14 million dollars*** and a `yearly total gross` of around ***9 to 12 billion dollars***.

The purpose of the project is to answer two questions:

* How does `Ratings`, `Directors`, `Actors`, `Genres`, `Metascores`, `Runtimes`, and `Revenue` affect the success of a movie and create bias reviews?
* Does `Ratings` correlate with `Metascores`, or do they conflict with each other?

This project will be using the **IMDB_movies.csv** dataset, which is available in the link, [IMDB_movies.csv](https://github.com/reisanar/datasets/blob/master/IMDB_movies.csv) and in `Section 2: Data Analysis`.

## Section 2: Data Analysis
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
IMDB <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reisanar/datasets/master/IMDB_movies.csv")
IMDB
```
The dataset, ***IMDB_movies.csv***, is a collection of the most popular movies rated on IMDb for the past decade. The data fields included are `Rank`, `Title`, `Genre`, `Description`, `Director`, `Actors`, `Year`, `Runtime (Minutes)`, `Rating`, `Votes`, `Revenue (Millions)`, and `Metascore`. **IMDB_movies.csv** was provided by ***Professor Rei Sanchez-Arias*** under his GitHub account, ***reisanar***. The dataset only contains 1000 movies (rows) from 2006 to 2016, so movies past 2006 and from the 20th century will take no part in this analysis. 

This section will have 5 subsections: *Genre's Average rating, Director’s Effect on Rating and Metascore, Ratings Vs Metascores, Runtime’s Effect on Rating and Metascore, and Rating’s and Metascore’s Effect on Revenue*. Each sub-section will illustrate how `Genre`, `Director`, `Revenue`, `Metascore`, `Runtime`, and `Revenue` affects a movie's box office success and creates bias reviews.

Genre_Average_Rating<-data.frame(Genre, Average_Rate_Genre)
Genre_Rating_Order<-Genre_Average_Rating %>%
  arrange(desc(Average_Rate_Genre))
Genre_Rating_Order
```
*The data frame above shows the average rating based on genre and is arranged by average rating in descending order.*

### Section 2.2: Director's Effect on Rating 

Ratings can be affected by who directed the movie. Directors can cause bias in a movie's `Rating` which can conflict with the movie's `Metascore`. This theory will be tested by analyzing each `Director's` frequency of highly rated movies in a data frame called, **num_movies_by_director**. This dataframe will be visualized in a bar chart called **Director's Movie Count (n) w/ High Ratings**, which `n` represents the number of movies and `reorder(Director, n)` lists the `Directors` who made the most movies.
```{r}
# Version 1
# IMDB_with_Dir_tally <- IMDB %>%
#       arrange(desc(Rating)) %>%
#       select(Title, Director, Actors, Rating, Metascore) %>% 
#       group_by(Director) %>% 
#       mutate(count_mov = n())
# IMDB_with_Dir_tally

# Data Frame that lists Directors by Descending Number of Movies
num_movies_by_director<-tally(group_by(IMDB,Director), sort=TRUE) %>%
  head(n=10)
num_movies_by_director
```
```{r}
# Data Frame that lists Directors by Descending Average Rating
avg_rating_Dir_table<- IMDB %>% 
  group_by(Director) %>%
  summarize(avg_rating=mean(Rating, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_rating)) %>%
  head(n=10)
avg_rating_Dir_table
```
```{r}
# Director's Movie Count (n) w/ Highest Ratings Bar Chart
ggplot(data = num_movies_by_director, mapping = aes(x = reorder(Director, n), n)) +
  ggtitle("Director's Movie Count (n) w/ Highest Ratings") +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color="black", fill="green") + coord_flip()
# Director's Average Rating Bar Chart
ggplot(data = avg_rating_Dir_table, mapping = aes(x = reorder(Director, avg_rating), avg_rating)) + 
    ggtitle("Director's Average Rating") +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color="black", fill="pink") + coord_flip()
```
Based on the average `Ratings` and highest frequency of movies, ***Christopher Nolan*** is the most frequent director with one of the highest `Ratings` from his 5 movies: *The Dark Knight, Inception	, Interstellar, The Prestige, and The Dark Knight Rises*. The `Director` ranked 9th in the data frame, **Director's Movie Count (n) w/ Highest Ratings**, and 2nd in the data frame, **Director's Average Rating**.

However, one of the movies (***The Dark Knight Rises***) is a sequel of the other and is based on a very popular *Marvel* icon, *Batman*, which could have compromised the legitimacy of the `Ratings`.
```{r}
# Data Frame that lists Christopher Nolan's Movies by Descending Rating
Christopher_Nolan<-IMDB %>%
  arrange(desc(Rating)) %>%
  select(Title, Genre, Director, Actors, Rating, Metascore) %>%
  filter(Director == 'Christopher Nolan')
Christopher_Nolan
```
Choice of `Genre` could have played a role in *Nolan's* success, since his movies are categorized with one of the most popular movie `Genres`:

* ***Drama*** has the **5th** highest Rating based on `Genre` (**6.953801**
)
* ***Mystery*** has the **6th** highest `Rating` based on `Genre` (**6.886792**)
* ***Crime*** has the **7th** highest `Rating` based on `Genre` (**6.786667**)
* ***Adventure*** has the **8th** highest `Rating` based on `Genre` (**6.772201**)
* ***SciFi*** has the **9th** highest `Rating` based on `Genre` (**6.716667**)
* ***Action*** has the **12th** highest `Rating` based on `Genre` (**6.614521**)
* ***Thriller*** has the **13th** highest `Rating` based on `Genre` (**6.593333**)
```{r}
Genre_Rating_Order %>%
  filter(Genre == "Drama" | Genre =="Mystery" | Genre =="Crime" | Genre =="Adventure" | Genre =="SciFi" | Genre =="Action" | Genre =="Thriller")
```
Christian Bale has an average movie `Rating` of ***7.246154***. This actor has played in 3 major roles of Nolan's movies---**The Dark Knight, The Prestige, and The Dark Knight Rises**. These 3 movies have been successful due to ***Christian Bale's*** contribution as an actor. 
```{r}
# Average Rating of Christian Bale
Christian_Bale<-IMDB %>%
  filter(grepl('Christian Bale', Actors))
summarize(Christian_Bale,avgRat_Christ_Bale=mean(Rating, na.rm = TRUE))

```
Therefore, the most successful `Director` based on frequency of highly rated movies is ***Christian Nolan***. The reasons for his success is that one of his movies is a sequel of a previously successful movie, his `Genre` choice, and the `Actors` who played a role in his movies.  

### Section 2.3: Ratings Vs Metascores

`Ratings` and `Metascore` are not exclusively equivalent, since `Ratings` are made by ordinary people while `Metascores` are made by licensed critics. This idea will be explored with two dataframes---**RateVsMeta**, which is arranged in descending `Rating`, and **MetaVsRate**, which is arranged in descending `Metascore`. Let this project assume that a `Rating` of 10 is equivalent to a `Metascore` of 100.
```{r}
# Data Frame arranged by Descending Rating with Average Rating and Average Metascore
RateVsMeta<-IMDB %>%
  select(Title, Rating, Metascore) %>%
  mutate(avg_rates=mean(Rating), avg_meta=mean(Metascore, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(Rating))
RateVsMeta
# Data Frame arranged by Metascore with Average Rating and Average Metascore
MetaVsRate<- IMDB %>%
  select(Title, Metascore, Rating) %>%
  mutate(avg_meta=mean(Metascore, na.rm=TRUE), avg_rates=mean(Rating)) %>%
  arrange(desc(Metascore))
MetaVsRate
```
The top 20 rated movies in the table, **RateVsMeta**, shows that 5 movies have shown very conflicting `Ratings` and `Metascores`: ***The Intouchables***	(`Rating` = **8.6**; `Metascore` = **57**), ***The Prestige***	(`Rating` = **8.5**;	`Metascore` = **66**), ***Taare Zameen Par***	(`Rating` = **8.5**;	`Metascore` = **42**), ***3 Idiots***	(`Rating` = **8.4**, `Metascore` = **67**), and ***Inglourious Basterds***	(`Rating` = **8.3**,	`Metascore` = **69**). However, the top 20 movies with the highest `Metascores` in the dataframe, **MetaVsRate**, had only one movie, ***Megan Is Missing***	(`Rating` = **94**;	`Metascore` = **4.9**), which had a conflicting `Rating` and `Metascore`.

These observations prove that people and critics have different criteria for ranking a movie's quality, which can be further proven in the scatter plot, **Rating Vs Metascore Scatter Plot**. The scatter plot shows that many highly rated movies fall under the `Metascore` coordinate of the regression line, but movies that performed very well in the `Metascore` rarely fall behind the `Ratings` on the line, which is illustrated in the scatter plot, **Metascore Vs Rating Scatter Plot**. 
```{r}
# Scatter Plot illustrating x = Ratings Vs y = Metascores
ggplot(data = RateVsMeta, aes(x = Rating, y = `Metascore`)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  ggtitle("Rating Vs Metascore Scatter Plot") 
# Scatter Plot illustrating x = Metascore Vs y = Rating
ggplot(data = RateVsMeta, aes(x = Metascore, y = `Rating`)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  ggtitle("Metascore Vs Rating Scatter Plot") 
```
The highest `Ratings` are more likely to have conflicting `Metascores`, since the points fall farther away from the regression line in the `Rating` coordinates of the scatter plot, **Rating Vs Metascore Scatter Plot**.  The highest `Metascores` are less likely to have conflicting `Ratings`, since the points fall closer towards the regression line in the `Metascore` coordinates of the scatter plot, **Metascore Vs Rating Scatter Plot**.

### Section 2.4: Runtime's Effect on Rating and Metascore

A movie's `Rating` and `Metascore` can be affected by the length of a movie i.e. a movie's `Runtime`. A longer `Runtime` allows a movie to explore its story more organically and are less likely to cut corners in order to fit a limited `Runtime`. Yet, an extended `Runtime` can make a movie's storyline lengthy and overdrawn, which can bring lower `Ratings` and `Metascores`. This idea will be explored with the dataframe called **RuntimeVsRateVsMeta** and two scatter plots---**Runtime Vs Rating Scatterplot** and **Runtime Vs Metascore Scatterplot**. 
```{r}
# Data Frame arranged by Descending Runtime with Rating and Metascore
RuntimeVsRateVsMeta<-IMDB %>%
  select(Title, `Runtime (Minutes)`, Rating, Metascore) %>%
  arrange(desc(`Runtime (Minutes)`))
RuntimeVsRateVsMeta
```
```{r}
# Scatter Plot illustrating how Runtime affects Ratings 
ggplot(data = RuntimeVsRateVsMeta, aes(x = `Runtime (Minutes)`, y = Rating)) + 
  ggtitle("Runtime Vs Rating Scatterplot") +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
#Close-up
ggplot(data = RuntimeVsRateVsMeta, aes(x = `Runtime (Minutes)`, y = Rating)) + 
  ggtitle("Runtime Vs Rating Scatterplot") +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(5, 8))
# Scatter Plot illustrating how Runtime affects Metascores 
ggplot(data = RuntimeVsRateVsMeta, aes(x = `Runtime (Minutes)`, y = Metascore)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Runtime Vs Metascore Scatterplot") +
  geom_smooth()
#Close-up
ggplot(data = RuntimeVsRateVsMeta, aes(x = `Runtime (Minutes)`, y = Metascore)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Runtime Vs Metascore Scatterplot") +
  geom_smooth() + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(55, 71))
```
Based on the 2 scatter plots, the regression line for the scatter plot, **Runtime Vs Rating Scatterplot**, is more linear than the regression line of the other scatter plot, **Runtime Vs Metascore Scatterplot**. This shows that movies' `Ratings` increase steadily as a movie's `Runtime` increases. `Metascores` increase in scores as a movies' `Runtime` increases, but movies with a `Runtime` of around **100 minutes** are more prone to score poorly than any other `Runtime` duration. 

Critics prefer a `Runtime` duration of more than **150 minutes** and see it as a more fitting duration that doesn't disturb the quality of a movie. However, critics view movies with a `Runtime` of around **100 minutes** as a hindrance to the movie's quality, while normal reviewers believe that a longer `Runtime` duration increases the quality of a movie.

### Section 2.5: Rating's and Metascore's Effect on Revenue

Usually in the first week of a movie's premiere, `Ratings` and `Metascores` are given by first-time viewers who want to give their opinion  of the quality of the movie. Besides the advertisements and who the `Actors` and the `Directors` are, `Ratings` and `Metscores` can greatly affect how much viewership and `Revenue` a movie gains in the box office, since positive reviews encourage people to buy tickets while negative reviews causes people to steer clear from the movie theaters.
```{r}
# Data Frame arranged by Descending Revenue with Rating and Metascore
RateVsMetaVsRevenue<-IMDB %>%
  select(Title, `Revenue (Millions)`, Rating, Metascore) %>%
  arrange(desc(`Revenue (Millions)`))
RateVsMetaVsRevenue
```

```{r}
# Scatter Plot illustrating how Ratings affects Revenue 
ggplot(data = RateVsMetaVsRevenue, aes(x = Rating, y = `Revenue (Millions)`)) + 
  ggtitle("Rating Vs Revenue Scatterplot") +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
# Close-up
ggplot(data = RateVsMetaVsRevenue, aes(x = Rating, y = `Revenue (Millions)`)) + 
  ggtitle("Rating Vs Revenue Scatterplot") +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(25, 175))
# Scatter Plot illustrating how Metascores affects Revenue 
ggplot(data = RateVsMetaVsRevenue, aes(x = Metascore, y = `Revenue (Millions)`)) + 
  ggtitle("Metascore Vs Revenue Scatterplot") +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()  
# Close-up
ggplot(data = RateVsMetaVsRevenue, aes(x = Metascore, y = `Revenue (Millions)`)) + 
  ggtitle("Metascore Vs Revenue Scatterplot") +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()  + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(25, 110))
```
In  the scatter plots, **Rating Vs Revenue Scatterplot**, `Revenue` exponentially grows as its `Ratings` increases. However, in the scatter plot **Metascore Vs Revenue Scatterplot**, `Revenue` has a logistic growth as `Metascore` increases. `Revenue` reaches a `Revenue` plateau of around ***$100 million*** with a `Metascore` range ***from 70 to 100***.

Therefore, higher `Ratings` (in an exponential sense) and higher `Metascores` (in a logistic sense), will lead to higher `Revenue` and viewership in the box office.

## Section 3: Conclusion

The Box office industry is one of the highest-grossing media franchises that can accumulate a yearly average `box office revenue` of around ***11 to 14 million dollars*** and a yearly `total gross` of around ***9 to 12 billion dollars***. Many movies' box office success are affected by `Rating`, `Director`, `Actors`, `Genre`, `Metascore`, `Runtime`, and `Revenue`. 

Directors can earn top `Ratings` if they pick the right `Actors` and the most popular `Genres`. Not to mention, `Directors` can ride on previous success by making high-quality sequels. 

`Ratings` and `Metascores` can greatly conflict with each other. The highest `Ratings` are more prone to conflict with its `Metascores`, but the highest `Metascores` is less likely to conflict with its `Ratings`.

The length of a movie i.e. a movie's `Runtime` can affect the `Rating` and `Metascore` of the movie. Normal reviewers' `Ratings` steadily increases as the `Runtime` increases, while critics highly prefer a `Runtime`  of **150 minutes** over a `Runtime` of **100 minutes**.

During the first week of a movie’s premiere, `Ratings` and `Metascores` are distributed and can greatly affect the box office success and `Revenue` of a movie. `Ratings` cause an exponential growth for a movie's `Revenue`, while `Metascores` can cause a logistic growth for a movie's `Revenue`. 

A movie's `Rating`, `Director`, `Actors`, `Genre`, `Metascore`, `Runtime`, and `Revenue` play a direct role for a movie's success and can increase positive feedback. However, some of these factors can create biasness that deter the integrity of the `Rating` and `Metascore`.
