# Data Description: IMDB movies data


The dataset, ***IMDB_movies.csv***, is a collection of popular movies rated on IMDb for the past decade with 12 data fields:
- `Rank` 
- `Title`
- `Genre`
- `Description`
- `Director`
- `Actors`
- `Year`
- `Runtime (Minutes)`
- `Rating`
- `Votes`
- `Revenue (Millions)`
- `Metascore`. 

**IMDB_movies.csv** was provided by ***Professor Rei Sanchez-Arias*** under his GitHub account, ***reisanar***. The dataset only contains 1000 movies (rows) from 2006 to 2016, so movies past 2006 and from the 20th century will take no part in this analysis.
