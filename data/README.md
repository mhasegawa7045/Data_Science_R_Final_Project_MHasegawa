# Data Description: IMDB movies data

The dataset, ***IMDB_movies.csv***, is a collection of popular movies rated on IMDb for the past decade. The data fields included are `Rank`, `Title`, `Genre`, `Description`, `Director`, `Actors`, `Year`, `Runtime (Minutes)`, `Rating`, `Votes`, `Revenue (Millions)`, and `Metascore`. **IMDB_movies.csv** was provided by ***Professor Rei Sanchez-Arias*** under his GitHub account, ***reisanar***. The dataset only contains 1000 movies (rows) from 2006 to 2016, so movies past 2006 and from the 20th century will take no part in this analysis.
