The purpose of the project is to answer two questions:

* How does `Ratings`, `Directors`, `Actors`, `Genres`, `Metascores`, `Runtimes`, and`Revenue` affect the success of a movie and create bias reviews?
* Does `Ratings` correlate with `Metascores`, or do they conflict with each other?

This project will be using the **IMDB_movies.csv** dataset, which is available in the link, [IMDB_movies.csv](https://github.com/reisanar/datasets/blob/master/IMDB_movies.csv) and in `Section 2: Data Analysis`.
